# PAP Claudia e Filhos - Online Shopping Website

This project is a basic PHP-based online shopping website that allows users to place orders, which are then sent via email for easy order management.

## Technologies Used

- PHP
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Composer (for dependency management, including email functionality)

## Project Setup

To enable the email sending functionality, you need to install the required dependencies via Composer.

### Steps to configure Composer:

1. Make sure [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is installed on your system.

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project root directory.

3. Run the following command to install the dependencies:
 ```bash
composer install
```
4. After installation, configure the email settings in the appropriate file (e.g., `mail.php`) by setting your SMTP credentials and other necessary options.

## Usage

Deploy the project on a local server environment (such as XAMPP, MAMP) or any web server with PHP support.

Run `composer install` to install dependencies.

Access the website via your browser and place an order.

The order details will be sent by email according to your configured settings.


## To view the website locally:
